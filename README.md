# Final-Project
WoW Classic Dmg Calculator
    
    My project is a World of Warcraft damage calculator for non-standard paladin builds.  It will allow a player to import csv files with their characters equipment in order to predict the average dmg they should do in a minute. They will also be able to interact with the progrm to use inputs to replace any specific item on their character to test minor variations without needing entirely new csv files. Because of the time constraint this project is limited to the paladin character class and will also only cover a couple of variations of the paladins potential builds in terms of variables besides equipment.  Given more time it can and will be expanded to allow for changes in character talents and also to cover other classes.
